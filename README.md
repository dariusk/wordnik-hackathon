The Wordnik / Bot Summit Hackathon

For more information, see the website (coming soon).

## When is this?

It runs from Friday Nov 7 until Sunday Nov 9. 

## How to Participate

Open an issue on this repo and declare your intent to participate. You may continually update the issue as you work over the course of the weekend. Feel free to post dev diaries, sample output, etc.

Also feel free to comment on other participants' issues.

## Resources

The [Wordnik API is well documented](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs), but you're going to need to [sign up for an API key](http://developer.wordnik.com/) to do anything with it.

There's [an open issue](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/11) where you can add resources (libraries, corpuses, APIs, techniques, etc).
